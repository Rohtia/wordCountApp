This is my submission for [Scrimba's](https://scrimba.com/) Weekly Web Dev Challenge. Number 43: Word Count.

I only started coding on 17 Sep 21 (21 days ago), and my initial commit took me about 3 hours to write, so I'm pretty happy with that. Still, I will be doing more work on it before I submit it for the competition.
